              <h2 class="card-title">Who I am — outside the race lane</h2>
              <p class="card-body">
                I’m not a full-time athlete. I’m a retired U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Five, a working professional,
                and a guy who still answers emails, pays bills, and grocery shops like everyone else.
                HYROX is layered on top of a normal life — early mornings, structured training, and deliberate recovery.
              </p>
              <p class="card-body">
                I spent decades in environments where discipline, clarity under pressure, and physical readiness were
                non-negotiable. That experience never left — I’ve just redirected it. Now, instead of preparing for
                deployments, I’m preparing my body and mind to stay sharp, strong, and useful for as long as possible.
              </p>
              <p class="card-body">
                This site is my way of documenting the process — not as a social media highlight reel, but as a
                transparent log of what it actually takes for a man over 50 to train, recover, and compete at a high
                standard without making fitness a full-time job.

          <h2 class="section-title">HYROX Over-50 Elite Identity</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">
            This isn’t a slogan. It’s the standard I hold myself to when nobody is watching.
          </p>

          <article class="card identity-card">
            <h3 class="card-title">HYROX OVER-50 ELITE IDENTITY STATEMENT</h3>
            <p class="card-body"><strong>Jeff Lamothe — U.S. Army Retired CW5</strong></p>

            <p class="card-body">
              I am the exception, not the rule. At an age where most men are slowing down, I am accelerating.
              I train, I compete, and I pursue excellence with the same discipline and intensity that defined my career
              as a Soldier. HYROX is not a hobby for me — it is the arena where I prove that standards don’t fade with age.
            </p>

            <p class="card-body">
              I stand in the 0.01% of men my age worldwide — the rare few who choose effort over excuses,
              pressure over comfort, and discipline over decline. I don’t wait for motivation. I live by structure,
              consistency, and a relentless drive to improve.
            </p>

            <p class="card-body">
              My age is a weapon, not a limitation. Experience gives me clarity. Discipline gives me endurance.
              Resilience gives me power.
            </p>

            <p class="card-body">
              I live by the ethos of the silent professional.
              I don’t seek applause. I seek progress. I show up — every day, every session, every race —
              with the quiet confidence of someone who has nothing to prove, yet refuses to settle.
            </p>

            <p class="card-body">
              I train to win the war against complacency. While most men my age fight against slowing
              metabolisms, fading energy, and shrinking ambition, I fight a different battle — the battle to
              stay sharp, strong, and dangerous. HYROX is my proving ground.
            </p>

            <p class="card-body">
              I am not built for average. I am built for resilience. Built for intensity. Built for the long fight.
            </p>

            <p class="card-body">
              This is my identity:
              <br>• Over-50.
              <br>• HYROX competitor.
              <br>• Tactical athlete.
              <br>• Professional at work.
              <br>• Warrior at heart.
              <br>• A man in rare territory.
            </p>

              I am HYROX Over-50 Elite. And I am just getting started.

          <h2 class="section-title">My Training Ethos</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">
            The principles that sit underneath every session, every decision, and every block of training.
          </p>

          <article class="card ethos-card">
            <ul class="ethos-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Show up, especially when it’s not convenient.</strong>
                Progress at 50+ doesn’t come from perfect conditions, it comes from consistency on ordinary days.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Train with intent, not ego.</strong>
                Every run, lift, and interval has a purpose — to build capacity, resilience, or skill, not just to chase fatigue.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Let data inform, not control.</strong>
                HRV, VO2 Max, sleep scores, and zone time guide the plan—but they don’t replace listening to how the body feels.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Protect the long game.</strong>
                I’d rather stack months and years of healthy training than win a single session and lose a season to injury.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Carry it into real life.</strong>
                The discipline I build in training should spill into work, relationships, and how I show up for people around me.
              </li>
