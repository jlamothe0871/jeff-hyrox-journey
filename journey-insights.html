        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            HYROX is a hybrid event, but the limiter for most athletes isn’t strength — it’s the ability to
            <strong>recover while moving</strong>. VO₂ max is a proxy for your aerobic “ceiling,” and raising that
            ceiling improves how quickly you can clear fatigue between stations like sleds, lunges, burpees, and wall balls.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the first two weeks we emphasized VO₂ max because it creates the foundation that makes everything else work:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Faster recovery between stations:</strong> better oxygen delivery helps you settle your breathing and heart rate sooner.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher sustainable pace:</strong> you can run harder in Zone 2/3 without blowing up in Zone 4/5.</li>
            <li><strong>Better HRV and readiness:</strong> improved aerobic fitness reduces overall stress load for the same work.</li>
            <li><strong>More “repeatability”:</strong> HYROX rewards consistent output; VO₂ max supports repeat efforts under fatigue.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower perceived effort:</strong> the same workout feels easier, which frees you to focus on technique and transitions.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="callout">
            <strong>Bottom line:</strong> VO₂ max work helps you go faster <em>without</em> getting winded, and it improves your ability to
            recover mid-race — which is exactly what HYROX demands.
          </div>

          <p style="margin-top:12px; color: var(--muted);">
            As the foundation stabilizes, focus shifts toward station efficiency (technique), lactate tolerance,
            and race-specific pacing — built on top of that aerobic engine.

      <p class="question">I notice multiple NSDR breathing sessions on some days and at least one every day. What is NSDR and why is it important to HYROX?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chev" aria-hidden="true">⌄</div>
  </summary>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      <strong>NSDR</strong> stands for <strong>Non-Sleep Deep Rest</strong>. It’s a short, guided breathing and body-scan practice
      that places the nervous system into a deeply relaxed state <em>without</em> sleeping.
      Think of it as structured recovery for your brain and nervous system.
    </p>

    <p>
      HYROX places repeated stress on the body: high heart rates, heavy muscular fatigue, and limited recovery time.
      If your nervous system stays stuck in “go mode,” performance drops and recovery slows.
      NSDR helps restore balance so you can train hard and absorb the work.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faster recovery between sessions:</strong> down-regulates stress so the body can repair and adapt.</li>
      <li><strong>Better pacing control:</strong> a calmer nervous system improves breathing rhythm and decision-making under fatigue.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved HRV and readiness:</strong> consistent NSDR supports parasympathetic recovery signals.</li>
      <li><strong>Sleep quality support:</strong> helps reduce “wired but tired” evenings during heavy training weeks.</li>
      <li><strong>Repeatable output:</strong> HYROX rewards athletes who can recover quickly and perform again — NSDR trains that skill.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Why multiple sessions?</strong> On hard training days, travel days, or high-stress days, short NSDR sessions
      act as “reset buttons” — post-workout, mid-day, or before bed — to keep recovery on track.
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:12px; color: var(--muted);">
      Bottom line: NSDR isn’t passive relaxation — it’s an intentional recovery tool that allows higher training quality,
      better consistency, and improved race-day composure.

      <div class="kicker">INSIGHT #03 • Winter Protocol</div>
      <p class="question">What’s your winter training protocol to keep VO₂ max trending up (and tracking clean) when it’s cold and routines get disrupted?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chev" aria-hidden="true">⌄</div>
  </summary>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      Winter is when VO₂ max readings can get noisy and training consistency can get fragile (cold temps, travel, poor sleep,
      holiday stress, reduced outdoor volume). My goal in winter is simple:
      <strong>keep the aerobic engine progressing</strong> while protecting recovery so the VO₂ trend stays meaningful.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>1 “Anchor VO₂” session per week:</strong> short, hard intervals (controlled) to keep the ceiling rising.</li>
      <li><strong>2 aerobic base sessions per week:</strong> Zone 2 work to build capacity and improve recovery between efforts.</li>
      <li><strong>1 HYROX-specific compromised run day:</strong> station-to-run combinations to keep race feel without overcooking fatigue.</li>
      <li><strong>Strength stays, volume gets smarter:</strong> maintain strength, but don’t let leg soreness crush run quality.</li>
      <li><strong>NSDR is non-negotiable:</strong> quick downshifts to keep stress from masking fitness in the metrics.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Tracking rule:</strong> VO₂ max is a trend, not a daily grade. In winter, I focus on a clean weekly pattern:
      consistent sessions + consistent sleep + consistent recovery = a reading you can trust.
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:12px; color: var(--muted);">
      If the ring/watch dips during winter (cold sleep environment, travel, dehydration, late workouts), I don’t panic.
      I tighten the protocol: hydration, sleep timing, Zone 2, and one quality VO₂ session — and the trend corrects.

      <div class="kicker">INSIGHT #04 • Travel & Recovery</div>
      <p class="question">
        What did last week of travel teach you about recovery, readiness, and training control?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chev" aria-hidden="true">⌄</div>
  </summary>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      Last week reinforced a simple truth: <strong>travel doesn’t break fitness — unmanaged recovery does</strong>.
      Flights, disrupted sleep, time-zone shifts, and long days quietly tax the nervous system even when workouts
      still “look good” on paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      The biggest lesson wasn’t about doing less work — it was about doing the <em>right</em> work when recovery
      signals are compromised.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Readiness matters more than intent:</strong> when HRV and resting HR are off, intensity needs tighter control.</li>
      <li><strong>Zone 2 becomes a stabilizer:</strong> aerobic work maintains momentum without adding recovery debt.</li>
      <li><strong>NSDR isn’t optional while traveling:</strong> it becomes the primary tool for nervous system reset.</li>
      <li><strong>Short sessions beat skipped sessions:</strong> consistency preserves rhythm even when volume drops.</li>
      <li><strong>Metrics lag reality:</strong> recovery debt shows up days later — plan proactively, not reactively.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> travel weeks require tighter guardrails, not tougher workouts.
      The goal is to protect the engine so quality can return quickly once routine normalizes.
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:12px; color: var(--muted);">
      Managing travel well isn’t about pushing through fatigue — it’s about staying disciplined enough
      to arrive back home ready to train, not needing a reset week to recover.
